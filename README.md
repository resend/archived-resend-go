    }

    if res.SendEmailResponse != nil {
        // handle response
    }
```
<!-- End SDK Example Usage -->

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being Bearer re_123456789 where re_123456789 is your [API Key](https://resend.com/login?redirectedFrom=%2Fapi-keys).

```bash
Authorization: Bearer re_123
```
